VSRename
========
Usage:
	VSRename.exe <path> <find> <replace with> [<true - only search and replace file content> <only files with extension>]

This allows you to rename Visual Studio projects. There are two stages in renaming projects:

1) Rename directories and files (skipping .svn, .nuget and packages paths):
	Example:
			vsrename . OldProjectName NewProjectName

2) Rename the content including solution to the new name  
	Example: 
		vsrename . OldProjectName NewProjectName true *.*
